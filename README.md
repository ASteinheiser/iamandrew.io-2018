# iamandrew.io
This is a simple site that I created using [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to showcase my projects and articles as well as providing my contact information.

### Run it locally
```
git clone https://github.com/ASteinheiser/iamandrew.io.git
cd iamandrew.io
npm install
npm start
```
